# Craft Clear Template Caches

Craft plugin to add a "Clear Template Caches" widget for the Dashboard.

## Why would I want this?

Admin users can clear template caches from within the `Settings` section of the Craft cp, but there's no way to give a non-admin user the ability to clear template caches without also giving them access to everything in `Settings`. Also, even for admin users this is an easier way to clear template caches.

## Installation

1. Download this repo.
2. Rename the folder to "cleartemplatecache"
3. Drag into your `/craft/plugins` folder.
4. Install via the Craft Control Panel.
5. Click `New Widget` on your Dashboard to add the widget.
